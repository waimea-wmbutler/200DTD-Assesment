# Teacher Feedback on Documentation and Other Evidence

> William... There is very little in your development log. It's Week 6 now - really should have more to show.

> Some issues with Implications

> Oh, and... You really need to use capital letters in the correct places - start of sentences, and for 'I'!
 

## System Requirements	

- [x] **A** Purpose of outcome identified and described, listing specific requirements
- [x] **A** End-users identified and described, listing specific requirements
- [x] **A** Key functionality that satisfies the purpose and end-user requirements identified
- [ ] **A** Implications, relevant to purpose and end-users, are described and linked to design of outcome

> Usability - needs to be done in more detail. It's a key factor and you need to be referencing Nielsen's heuristics, etc.

> Aesthetics - you've said it's important, so what are you going to do during the design & making of your system? (Hint: constantly test with end users!)

> End-user - same as above - test!

> Social - what you've written about is really to do with privacy. Social would be more along the line of helping people in some way - e.g. to be in touch more, etc.

> Privacy is essential for your application - you need to be aware of the requirements of the NZ Privacy Act and make sure you meet its requirements (look it up - there are lots of guides)


## Database Structure	

- [ ] **A** Structure of the database is designed (tables, fields, data types, primary keys, relationships, etc.)
- [ ] **M** Structure of the database is logical (i.e. DB is normalised, tables / fields are named logically, etc.)

> Where is your DB design? Should be done by now.


## Front-End UI Designs

- [ ] **A** Design for key web pages have been sketched out with supporting notes, etc.

> Where is the UI 'flow' diagram you did on Excalidraw? Should be here.


## System Testing

### Functionality Testing

- [ ] **A** Functionality has been tested and there is evidence for this (screenshots, etc.)
- [ ] **M** Testing is thorough (all functionality covered)

> Comments...  

### Code Testing

- [ ] **E** Code (HTML and CSS) validates. Documented evidence for this

> Comments...  


## Improvements Based on Testing

- [ ] **M** Info. from testing has been used to improve the outcome
    - [ ] End-user feedback has been used to improve the system

### Iterative Improvements

- [ ] **E** Evidence of a series of planned, iterative design-test-improve cycles (at least three) used to refine one or more aspects of outcome
    - [ ] Design of the UI has been iterated
    - [ ] Implemented UI has been iterated
    - [ ] Implemented functionality has been iterated

> Comments...  


## Review and Evaluation

- [ ] **M** Discussion of how the relevant implications were addressed in the implementation of the outcome
