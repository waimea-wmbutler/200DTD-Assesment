## System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem

People can forget information about loved ones as they age, and this can cause awkward encounters with said people. they need a way to recall and look at the information about people, so that the meetings wont be so awkward this can also be used in a business standard, as admins can put information about people

### End-User Requirements

Typical end users are going to be grandparents and other quite forgetful people who need a quick reminder about their loved ones, or bosses who need to store other employees information in a business standard, but can also be used in any gathering place, so you can store information about anything e.g. cats, plants, cars, shops, people.

### Proposed Solution

This website/app will have all the information about your family or employees in one neat place, with information about their favourite food or date of birth, this also can be changed to hold other information, such as 'least favourite ...'. this website will hold the information about one person, until that person is removed or deleted from the website. the user can also add new people and change information about this person
